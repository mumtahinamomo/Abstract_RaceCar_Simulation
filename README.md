# Abstract_RaceCar_Stimulation
This is an updated version of "Race_Car_Simulation" which features a more flexible race simulation. By using an abstract "Car" class with subclasses (SportsCar and FormulaOne), this version of "Race_Car_Stimulation" enhances code reusability. The updated "TrackLoggerC" provides better logging capabilities than the initial "TrackLoggerB", and SimulationDriverC allows for more flexible and interactive race setup compared to the previous version "StimulationDriver". These changes improved the clarity and efficiency of logging compared to the initial version
